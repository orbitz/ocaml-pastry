* About
PASTRY is a DHT.
* Features
** DONE Key representation
Keys are 128 bit numeric value.

Operations:
- Relational comparison
- Common prefix digits given a particular base (1 <= b <= 8 for now)
** TODO Node
A node represents an abstract location.

A node is created and manipulated by the IO layer.

Nodes have a strict ordering between them.

Operations:
- distance - Give the distance to the node
- key - Key representation of the node
** TODO Routing table
Represents a table of nodes that the algorithm can route traffic to.  Each entry
in the table corresponds to a number of nodes.

The routing table two dimensional where the columns are the numeration of the
digits in the base the node id is represented in and the rows are the digits of
the node id.

Given a base = 4 node id of 10233102, a hypothetical routing table would be:

|--------+-----+----------+----------+----------+----------|
| NodeId | Pos |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |
|--------+-----+----------+----------+----------+----------|
|      1 |   0 | 02212102 |      (1) | 22301203 | 31203203 |
|      0 |   1 |      (0) | 11301233 | 12230203 | 13021022 |
|      2 |   2 | 10031203 | 10132102 |      (2) | 10323302 |
|      3 |   3 | 10200230 | 10211302 | 10222302 |      (3) |
|      3 |   4 | 10230322 | 10231000 | 10232121 |      (3) |
|      1 |   5 | 10233001 |      (1) | 10233232 |          |
|      0 |   6 |      (0) |          | 10233120 |          |
|      2 |   7 |          |          |      (2) |          |
|--------+-----+----------+----------+----------+----------|

Operations:
- Add a (nodeid, key)
- Delete by key
- Query a list of hosts given a key
** TODO Neighborhood set
Unclear if this is needed, looks like later versions of pastry remove this
** TODO Leaf set
The leaf set is an even number with value L.  Half the leaf set is devoted to
nodes whose value is smaller than the current nodeid and half devoted to larger.

Common values or 2^b or 2 x 2^b

NodeId 10233102

|----------+----------+----------+----------|
|  Smaller |  Smaller |   Larger |   Larger |
|----------+----------+----------+----------|
| 10233033 | 10233021 | 10233120 | 10233122 |
| 10233001 | 10233000 | 10233230 | 10233232 |
|----------+----------+----------+----------|

The table is just for visualizing it and the actual rows do not matter, just
that half of it is composed of nodes smaller and half of nodes larger.
